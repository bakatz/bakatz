ðŸ‘‹ &nbsp;Hey, Iâ€™m Ben and I write software. I'm currently a Software Engineer at DoorDash and I also work on https://swepro.co/course on the side, where I help teach people how to grow their careers as Software Engineers! See https://bakatz.com to learn more about me, or take a look at my pinned projects below for some of the significant OSS contributions I've made recently.
